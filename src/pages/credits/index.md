### Scratch 3.0

:::info[Scratch 3.0 and AGPL]
Scratch 3.0, with the exception of `scratch-blocks`, has been relicensed to the [GNU Affero General Public License v3](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-gui/blob/eec78119b42129f6870f6981fa14303ee094e019/LICENSE). Currently, the code included in the tutorials is from before the relicensing and is still under the [BSD 3-Clause license](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-gui/blob/1c9ff0dcfcfc9ffee992158bf906e590ad2fb566/LICENSE). Learn more about the relicensing at https://scratchfoundation.org/open-source-license.

**If you want to mod Scratch under the BSD 3-Clause license:** You must use the code from before it was relicensed and not take any code from newer versions of the Scratch 3.0 code.

**Note:** While the tutorials currently do not use code from AGPL-licensed versions of Scratch 3.0, the tutorials will be updated if they become outdated.
