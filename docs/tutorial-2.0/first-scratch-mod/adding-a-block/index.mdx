# Adding a Block

## What block are we adding?
Let's add a very simple block, this will use Scratch's `DialogBox.notify` function.

<ScratchBlocks style="scratch2">
    alert [Hello!]::looks
</ScratchBlocks>

## Making the block
The first step to adding a block is actually making the block itself.

In Scratch 2.0, all blocks are defined in an array called `commands` in a file called `Specs.as`, which is located in the `src` folder.

### Anatomy of a block
Let's take a look at the first block in the file, which is `forward:` or <ScratchBlocks inline style="scratch2">move (10) steps</ScratchBlocks>.

```actionscript title="src/Specs.as"
public static var commands:Array = [
    // block specification					type, cat, opcode			default args (optional)
    // motion
    // highlight-next-line
    ["move %n steps",						" ", 1, "forward:",					10],
```

The `commands` array contains an array for each block. Each block's array contains the following:

1. The name of the block ("block specification"). This is what Scratch displays on the block. In this block it is `move %n steps`.
2. The type of the block. A single space (` `) is a normal stack block, `r` is a reporter, `b` is a boolean, `h` is a hat, `c` is a C block, and more. This is a stack block so it is a single space ` `.
3. The category of the block, this is a integer. The list of valid categories can be found in `Specs.as` in an array called `categories`. This is a motion block, which is category ID `1`. `100` is added to the category ID for the Stage version of a category.
4. The opcode of the block. This is what Scratch uses to identify this block.
5. (Optional) Default arguments for each input.

#### The block name/specification
If you look at the name of the move steps block, `move %n steps`, you will notice the `%n`, this is a number input. Inputs are a percent sign (`%`), followed by a letter (like `n` for number), and, in the case of menus, it will also have a `.` and then the ID of a menu.

It can also contain icons, which start with a `@`, for example `@greenFlag`.

A list of these codes can be found [here](/resources/s2-block-input-spec).

### Adding our own block
We will add our block to the `looks` category, so find the `// looks` comment within the `commands` array and add this under it

```actionscript title="src/Specs.as"
// looks
// highlight-next-line
["alert %s", " ", 2, "tutorialModAlert", "Hello!"],
```

:::caution
Don't forget the `,` at the end!
:::

:::tip
If you want, you can add spaces after the commas to make the block spec array match with the existing ones.
:::

1. `alert %s` is the name of the block. This block is called "alert" and has a string input.
2. ` ` is the type of block. This block is a stack block.
3. `2` is the category the block is in. This block is a looks block, which is category ID `2`.
4. `tutorialModAlert` is the the block's opcode (or ID). This block is `tutorialModAlert`.
5. `Hello!` is the default value for the string input.

But, since the looks category shows different blocks depending on if you are on the Stage or not, you will need to add it to the Stage version of the category too. To do this, you need to add the block to the `// stage looks` section and change the category ID from `2` to `102`. All information, other than the category ID, should be the same as the original entry.

### Implementing the block
Our block doesn't do anything, since we haven't given it any code yet, so let's do that now. Implementations for the blocks are located in the `primitives` folder. The looks primitives are located in the `LooksPrims.as` file.

First, we need to import `DialogBox` so we can actually display a notify box. Under the other `import`s near the top of the file add:

```actionscript title="src/primitives/LooksPrims.as"
package primitives {
	import flash.utils.Dictionary;
	import blocks.*;
	import interpreter.*;
	import scratch.*;
    // highlight-next-line
    import uiwidgets.DialogBox;
```

Second, we need to write our function, these can be located anywhere inside the class, but you should place your block's function with the other block functions (the ones that start with `prim`). We will call our block function `primTutorialModAlert`, but we could have put anything.

```actionscript title="src/primitives/LooksPrims.as"
private function primTutorialModAlert(b:Block):void {
    // DialogBox.notify usage:
    // * First argument is the title for the alert box.
    // * Second argument is the message.
    DialogBox.notify("Tutorial Mod", interp.arg(b, 0));
}
```

The `interp` class variable contains the Scratch `Interpreter`. You can use the `interp.arg` function to retrieve the value of an argument. `b` function parameter contains the block instance. `0` is the index of the argument you wish to retrieve, `0` being the first argument.

:::tip

If you want to retrieve as a number or boolean, you can use `interp.numarg` and `interp.boolarg`.

:::

Finally, we need to tell Scratch which block the function is for. To do this, near the top of the file, add your block to the `primTable`.

```actionscript title="src/primitives/LooksPrims.as"
primTable['tutorialModAlert'] = primTutorialModAlert;
```

## Trying the block
Let's try our new block, run `gradlew build` and open `Scratch.swf` (located in `build/11.6`) in Flash Player projector. You should see your block in the Looks category.
