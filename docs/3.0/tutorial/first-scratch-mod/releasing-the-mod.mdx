# Releasing the Mod

:::warning[Scratch 3.0 and AGPL]
Scratch 3.0 [has been relicensed](https://scratchfoundation.org/open-source-license) to be under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-gui/blob/eec78119b42129f6870f6981fa14303ee094e019/LICENSE). This means that, if you release your mod, you must also release the source code of your mod with it.

<details>

    <summary>Useful Information</summary>

    **What if my mod is based on an older pre-AGPL licensed version of Scratch 3.0?**
    > This means you are still using a [BSD 3-Clause](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-gui/blob/1c9ff0dcfcfc9ffee992158bf906e590ad2fb566/LICENSE) licensed version of Scratch. You are not required to release the source code of your mod.

    **What does the AGPL license require?**
    > A simple overview of the license can be found [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/). _Tip: Hover your mouse over the points under permission/conditions/limitations for a description of them._

    **What version of Scratch 3.0 is the code linked at the end of the tutorials from?**
    > The tutorials currently are based on a BSD 3-Clause licesned version of Scratch 3.0. However, they will be updated to an AGPL licensed version if the BSD 3-Clause licesned version becomes outdated.

    **How do I know if I'm using an AGPL or a BSD 3-Clause licensed version of Scratch 3.0?**
    > In your `scratch-gui` or `scratch-vm` folder, check the `LICENSE.md` file. If it starts with `GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE`, then you are using an AGPL licensed version of Scratch 3.0.

## GitHub (with GitHub Actions) <span class="badge badge--primary">Recommended</span>
:::info
This section expects that you forked the Scratch repositories and cloned your fork when initally setting up your mod.
:::

### Commit and push your changes
First, you will need to commit and push your changes to GitHub.

```shell
git commit -am "any commit message you want... should describe your changes."
git push origin develop
```

:::info
`develop` is the main branch for most Scratch repositories.
:::

### Add GitHub Actions workflow
In your `scratch-gui` repository, add a `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file.

```yaml title="scratch-gui/.github/workflows/publish.yml"
name: Publish

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
          cache: "npm"
      
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Scratch
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Upload the pages artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
        with:
          path: ./build
  
  deploy:
    needs: build
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Publish Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

Next, make sure that GitHub Pages's Source setting is set to "GitHub Actions" in your repository's `Settings -> Pages`.

Finally, go to the Actions tab, go to "Publish" on the left sidebar, press "Run workflow" (in the blue banner), ensure the `develop` branch is selected and press "Run workflow" to build and publish Scratch to GitHub Pages.

### Improvements
You could improve this by automatically rebuilding when you push to the repository or when you publish a release.

#### Run on push to repository
```yaml title="scratch-gui/.github/workflows/publish.yml"
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "develop"
```

#### Run on release publish
```yaml title="scratch-gui/github/workflows/publish.yml"
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
```

## Manual Hosting
Run this command to build `scratch-gui`. Once you have run the command, you will have a folder called `build`, this contains the Scratch build.
<Tabs groupId="package-manager" queryString>
    <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
            npm run build
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
            yarn run build
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
            pnpm run build
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you have built Scratch, you can upload the contents of the `build` folder anywhere you like.
