# Structure of Scratch

Unlike the previous versions of Scratch, Scratch 3.0 is separated into multiple packages, each of which is responsible for part of Scratch. For most mods, you probably do not need to modify (or even have a modifiable copy of) all the packages.

The <span class="badge badge--primary">Important</span> badge is used to indicate components that are important _in modding_ Scratch. Most of the components provide important functionality that Scratch would not work without or have a degraded experience without.
