# Adding Hat Blocks

## Hat Block Activation
There are two ways a hat block can be activated. They can be activated by telling Scratch VM to execute it elsewhere in the code or by letting Scratch VM constantly poll the block to see if the condition is true (this is called edge activation). You can also specify if the hat block's thread should be restarted if it is triggered again while it is already running.

## All Hat Blocks
Like with other types of blocks, hat blocks need to be defined in `scratch-blocks` and added to the toolbox in `scratch-gui`. So let's do that.

We are going to add these two blocks, one will be edge activated and the other won't be.

<ScratchBlocks>
{`when <>::hat events
when page visibility changed::hat events`}
</ScratchBlocks>

### `scratch-blocks`
In `scratch-blocks`, hat blocks are similar to other blocks, except they have the `shape_hat` extension.

```js title="scratch-blocks/blocks_vertical/event.js"
Blockly.Blocks['event_tutorialmod_when'] = {
  /**
   * @this Blockly.Block
   */
  init: function(){
    this.jsonInit({
      "message0": Blockly.Msg.EVENT_TUTORIALMOD_WHEN,
      "args0": [
        {
          "type": "input_value",
          "name": "CONDITION",
          "check": "Boolean"
        }
      ],
      "category": Blockly.Categories.event,
      // highlight-next-line
      "extensions": ["colours_event", "shape_hat"]
    });
  }
};

Blockly.Blocks['event_tutorialmod_whenpagevisibilitychanged'] = {
  /**
   * @this Blockly.Block
   */
  init: function(){
    this.jsonInit({
      "message0": Blockly.Msg.EVENT_TUTORIALMOD_WHENPAGEVISIBILITYCHANGED,
      "category": Blockly.Categories.event,
      // highlight-next-line
      "extensions": ["colours_event", "shape_hat"]
    });
  }
};
```

Don't forget to add `EVENT_TUTORIALMOD_WHEN` and `EVENT_TUTORIALMOD_WHENPAGEVISIBILITYCHANGED` messages, which should be `when %1` and `when page visibility changed`.

### `scratch-gui`
Add the blocks to the events category in the toolbox.

```js title="scratch-gui/src/lib/make-toolbox-xml.js"
<block type="event_tutorialmod_when"/>
<block type="event_tutorialmod_whenpagevisibilitychanged"/>
${blockSeparator}
```

## Edge Activated Block
The edge activated block method is easier to implement, so we will do it first for the `when <>` block.

Like other blocks, we add our block's function to `getPrimitives`, but we also add it to `getHats` this time. If the category you want to add the block to has no hats already, it probably won't have the `getHats` method, however it is easy to add based off the one in `scratch3_events.js`:

```js title="scratch-vm/src/blocks/scratch3_events.js"
getHats () {
    return {
        event_whenflagclicked: {
            restartExistingThreads: true
        },
        event_whenkeypressed: {
            restartExistingThreads: false
        },
        event_whenthisspriteclicked: {
            restartExistingThreads: true
        },
        event_whentouchingobject: {
            restartExistingThreads: false,
            edgeActivated: true
        },
        event_whenstageclicked: {
            restartExistingThreads: true
        },
        event_whenbackdropswitchesto: {
            restartExistingThreads: true
        },
        event_whengreaterthan: {
            restartExistingThreads: false,
            edgeActivated: true
        },
        event_whenbroadcastreceived: {
            restartExistingThreads: true
        }
    };
}
```

Since we are adding this to the `events` category, we will add our block to top of that `getHats`:

```js title="scratch-vm/src/blocks/scratch3_events.js"
event_tutorialmod_when: {
    restartExistingThreads: false,
    edgeActivated: true
},
```

`restartExistingThreads` is set to `false` to prevent Scratch from restarting the blocks under the hat while it is already running.

### Implementation
I've called the block's function `tutorialModWhen`. Implementing it is simple, you return `true` when you want the block to run and `false` otherwise.

```js title="scratch-gui/src/blocks/scratch3_events.js"
tutorialModWhen(args, util){
    return args.CONDITION;
}
```

## Non-Edge Activated Blocks
Unlike edge activated blocks, Scratch VM is not constantly checking if a condition is true, instead it is up to you to tell it when you want it to run.

Unlike other blocks, you do not make a block function or add the block to `getPrimitives`, but you still add the block to `getHats`, just without the `edgeActivated: true` part.

```js title="scratch-vm/src/blocks/scratch3_events.js"
event_tutorialmod_whenpagevisibilitychanged: {
    restartExistingThreads: true
},
```

We will add our event listener to the constructor in `scratch3_events.js`. We simply listen for the event we want (in this case `document`'s `visibilitychange` event) and use `startHats` from `Runtime` to execute the hats.

```js title="scratch-vm/src/blocks/scratch3_events.js"
document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", () => {
    this.runtime.startHats('event_tutorialmod_whenpagevisibilitychanged');
});
```

:::info
Scratch VM doesn't normally interact with the browser, instead Scratch GUI handles interacting with the browser and communicates with Scratch VM via events and Scratch VM's IO device system. However, for the purposes of this tutorial, it is easier to do it directly in Scratch VM than in Scratch GUI.
