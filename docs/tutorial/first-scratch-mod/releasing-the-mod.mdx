# Releasing the Mod

## GitHub (with GitHub Actions) <span class="badge badge--primary">Recommended</span>
:::info
This section expects that you forked the Scratch repositories and cloned your fork when initally setting up your mod.
:::

### Commit and push your changes
First, you will need to commit and push your changes to GitHub.

```shell
git commit -am "any commit message you want... should describe your changes."
git push origin develop
```

:::info
`develop` is the main branch for most Scratch repositories.
:::

### Add GitHub Actions workflow
In your `scratch-gui` repository, add a `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file.

```yaml title="scratch-gui/.github/workflows/publish.yml"
name: Publish

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
          cache: "npm"
      
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Scratch
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Upload the pages artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
        with:
          path: ./build
  
  deploy:
    needs: build
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Publish Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

Next, make sure that GitHub Pages's Source setting is set to "GitHub Actions" in your repository's `Settings -> Pages`.

Finally, go to the Actions tab, go to "Publish" on the left sidebar, press "Run workflow" (in the blue banner), ensure the `develop` branch is selected and press "Run workflow" to build and publish Scratch to GitHub Pages.

### Improvements
You could improve this by automatically rebuilding when you push to the repository or when you publish a release.

#### Run on push to repository
```yaml title="scratch-gui/.github/workflows/publish.yml"
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "develop"
```

#### Run on release publish
```yaml title="scratch-gui/github/workflows/publish.yml"
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
```

## Manual Hosting
Run this command to build `scratch-gui`. Once you have run the command, you will have a folder called `build`, this contains the Scratch build.
<Tabs groupId="package-manager" queryString>
    <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
            npm run build
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
            yarn run build
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
            pnpm run build
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you have built Scratch, you can upload the contents of the `build` folder anywhere you like.
