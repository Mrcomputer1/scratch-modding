# Adding a Block

:::info
This tutorial is for adding blocks as core blocks (blocks that are not included in an extensions) in a mod. If you want to add a custom extension to your Scratch mod, see the [Adding Extensions](../../adding-extensions/index.mdx) tutorial. If you want just want make a Scratch extension and not a Scratch mod, you probably want to look at [TurboWarp's custom extensions](https://docs.turbowarp.org/development/extensions/introduction) instead.
:::

## What block are we adding?
Let's add a very simple block, that uses the browser's `alert()` function to display a message.

<ScratchBlocks>
    alert [Hello!]::looks
</ScratchBlocks>

## Making the block
The first step to adding a block is actually making the block itself.

Since we are adding a looks blocks, we need to open the `looks.js` file. This file is part of `scratch-blocks` and is located at `blocks_vertical/looks.js`.

### Anatomy of a block
Let's take a look at the first block in the file, which is `looks_sayforsecs` or <ScratchBlocks inline>say [Hello!] for (2) secs</ScratchBlocks>. Explanations are included in the highlighted comments.

```js title="scratch-blocks/blocks_vertical/looks.js"
// highlight-start
// "Blockly.Blocks" is the object that contains the blocks in Scratch.
// "looks_sayforsecs" is the ID of the block.
// highlight-end
Blockly.Blocks['looks_sayforsecs'] = {
  // highlight-next-line
  // A JSDoc comment, it provides documentation about the code and may help your code editor provide relevant autocomplete suggestions.
  /**
   * Block to say for some time.
   * @this Blockly.Block
   */
  // highlight-next-line
  // The "init" function is called by Scratch Blocks/Blockly to initialise the block.
  init: function() {
    // highlight-next-line
    // this.jsonInit is a function that initialises the block with information provided in the form of a JavaScript object.
    this.jsonInit({
      // highlight-start
      // "message0" is the text the block displays. It currently is pointing to a translatable message (Blockly.Msg.).
      // The contents of Blockly.Msg.LOOKS_SAYFORSECS is "say %1 for %2 seconds".
      // The "%1" and "%2" are locations that will be replaced with something else, in this case input boxes.
      //
      // If a block has multiple parts, the number after "message" may be increased. An example is the forever block (CONTROL_FOREVER).
      // highlight-end
      "message0": Blockly.Msg.LOOKS_SAYFORSECS,
      // highlight-next-line
      // These are the replacements for the "%1" and "%2" from the block message. In this case, both are "input_value"s
      "args0": [
        {
          "type": "input_value",
          "name": "MESSAGE"
        },
        {
          "type": "input_value",
          "name": "SECS"
        }
      ],
      // highlight-next-line
      // The category the block is in.
      "category": Blockly.Categories.looks,
      // highlight-start
      // A list of "extensions" for the block, this is unrelated to the Scratch extensions system. These extensions modify the appearance of the blocks.
      // * "colours_looks": Applies the looks colour to the block.
      // * "shape_statement": Applies the standard statement/stack block style to the block.
      // highlight-end
      "extensions": ["colours_looks", "shape_statement"]
    });
  }
};
```

### Adding our own block
Choose a place in the file that you wish to add the block. I will add it near the top, under the `goog.require` lines.

:::caution

You must not add the blocks above the `goog.require` lines.

:::

```js title="scratch-blocks/blocks_vertical/looks.js"
// highlight-next-line
// You do not have to prefix your mod's block opcode with your mod name, but I like to.
Blockly.Blocks['tutorialmod_looks_alert'] = {
  /**
   * @this Blockly.Block
   */
  init: function(){
    this.jsonInit({
      // highlight-next-line
      // We will add the message next, however the contents of the message will be "alert %1".
      "message0": Blockly.Msg.TUTORIALMOD_LOOKS_ALERT, 
      "args0": [
        {
          "type": "input_value",
          "name": "MESSAGE"
        }
      ],
      "category": Blockly.Categories.looks,
      "extensions": ["colours_looks", "shape_statement"]
    });
  }
};
```

### Adding the block message
We need to add the `TUTORALMOD_LOOKS_ALERT` message we referenced in the block definition. For that, we need to open the `msg/messages.js` file in `scratch-blocks`.

Find the "Looks blocks" section of the file (you don't need to place it in the correct section, but it helps keep the file organised) and add this.

```js title="scratch-blocks/msg/messages.js"
// Looks blocks
// highlight-next-line
Blockly.Msg.TUTORIALMOD_LOOKS_ALERT = 'alert %1';
Blockly.Msg.LOOKS_SAYFORSECS = 'say %1 for %2 seconds';
```

### Rebuilding Scratch Blocks
:::info

**Reminder:** If you used Windows Subsystem for Linux or similar for `scratch-blocks`, you will need to use that now too.

:::

You need to rebuild Scratch Blocks every time you make a change to it.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager" queryString>
    <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
{`npm run translate
npm run prepublish`}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
{`yarn run translate
yarn run prepublish`}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
{`pnpm run translate
pnpm run prepublish`}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After rebuilding Scratch Blocks, you may have to restart the `scratch-gui` development server.

## Adding the block to the toolbox
Now, we need to move to `scratch-gui` to add the block to the toolbox. The toolbox is defined in `src/lib/make-toolbox-xml.js`. The file has a function for each category (for example, `looks` for the Looks category).

```js title="scratch-gui/src/lib/make-toolbox-xml.js"
const looks = function (isInitialSetup, isStage, targetId, costumeName, backdropName, colors) {
    const hello = ScratchBlocks.ScratchMsgs.translate('LOOKS_HELLO', 'Hello!');
    const hmm = ScratchBlocks.ScratchMsgs.translate('LOOKS_HMM', 'Hmm...');
    // Note: the category's secondaryColour matches up with the blocks' tertiary color, both used for border color.
    return `
    <category name="%{BKY_CATEGORY_LOOKS}" id="looks" colour="${colors.primary}" secondaryColour="${colors.tertiary}">
        // highlight-start
        <block type="tutorialmod_looks_alert">
            <value name="MESSAGE">
                <shadow type="text">
                    <field name="TEXT">${hello}</field>
                </shadow>
            </value>
        </block>
        ${blockSeparator}
        // highlight-end
        <!-- the rest of the blocks... -->
    </category>
    `;
}
```

## Trying the block
If the `scratch-gui` development server isn't running, start it now. You should see your new block at the top of the Looks category.

## Implementing your block
The block currently doesn't do anything. So let's implement the block. Implementations of blocks are located in `scratch-vm`, in the folder `src/blocks`. The looks blocks are in a file called `scratch3_looks.js`.

You should place your block's function inside the class, preferably below the `getPrimitives` function or the `getMonitored` and `getHats` functions if they are present. I will place the block above the `say` function, which is the `loosk_say` block. The name of the block function does not need to match the block's opcode.

```js title="scratch-vm/src/blocks/scratch3_looks.js"
tutorialModAlertBlock(args, util){
    alert(args.MESSAGE);
}
```

We also need to add the block to the `getPrimitives` function, which is how Scratch knows what function to call for a block.

```js title="scratch-vm/src/blocks/scratch3_looks.js"
/**
 * Retrieve the block primitives implemented by this package.
 * @return {object.<string, Function>} Mapping of opcode to Function.
 */
getPrimitives () {
    return {
        // highlight-next-line
        tutorialmod_looks_alert: this.tutorialModAlertBlock,
        looks_say: this.say,
        looks_sayforsecs: this.sayforsecs,
        looks_think: this.think,
        looks_thinkforsecs: this.thinkforsecs,
        looks_show: this.show,
        looks_hide: this.hide,
        looks_hideallsprites: () => {}, // legacy no-op block
        looks_switchcostumeto: this.switchCostume,
        looks_switchbackdropto: this.switchBackdrop,
        looks_switchbackdroptoandwait: this.switchBackdropAndWait,
        looks_nextcostume: this.nextCostume,
        looks_nextbackdrop: this.nextBackdrop,
        looks_changeeffectby: this.changeEffect,
        looks_seteffectto: this.setEffect,
        looks_cleargraphiceffects: this.clearEffects,
        looks_changesizeby: this.changeSize,
        looks_setsizeto: this.setSize,
        looks_changestretchby: () => {}, // legacy no-op blocks
        looks_setstretchto: () => {},
        looks_gotofrontback: this.goToFrontBack,
        looks_goforwardbackwardlayers: this.goForwardBackwardLayers,
        looks_size: this.getSize,
        looks_costumenumbername: this.getCostumeNumberName,
        looks_backdropnumbername: this.getBackdropNumberName
    };
}
```
