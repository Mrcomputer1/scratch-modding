# Adding C Blocks

Let's add this C block:

<ScratchBlocks style="scratch2">
{`run (50)% of the time {
    ...
}::operators`}
</ScratchBlocks>

## The block specification
In `Specs.as`, add the block to the `commands` array:

```actionscript title="src/Specs.as"
// control - sprite
["run %n% of the time",					"c", 6, "runPercentOfTheTime",  50],

// ...

// control - stage
["run %n% of the time",					"c", 106, "runPercentOfTheTime",  50],
```

You will notice the block type is `c`.

## The block implementation
Unlike normal blocks, which are implemented in the `primitives` directory, C blocks need to be implemented in the `Interpreter.as`. This is due to their need to access functions that aren't available outside the interpreter. Locate the rest of the primitives and add this:

```actionscript title="src/interpreter/Interpreter.as"
private function primRunSometimes(b:Block):void {
    if (b.subStack1 == null) return;
    if (Math.random() >= numarg(b, 0)) return;
    startCmdList(b.subStack1);
}
```

And, don't forget to add it to the `primTable`, which is located in a function called `initPrims`.

```actionscript title="src/interpreter/Interpreter.as"
primTable["runPercentOfTheTime"] = primRunSometimes;
```
