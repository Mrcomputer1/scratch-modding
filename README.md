## Contributing
For small changes, like a spelling/grammar fix, information correction, etc., just submit a pull request (or submit an issue if you don't want to do the correction yourself).

For larger changes, like adding a new page, reorganising content, rewriting an entire page, etc., create an issue first with details of what you intend to do. This is to allow a chance to review what you want to do before you do it to prevent you wasting your time writing a detailed page that is ultimately decided that it isn't needed, too specific, already in progress or similar.
